For illustration, we’ll use a sample from the Amazon musical instrument reviews dataset to determine the sentiment of each review. You can easily customize this example to work with your own data and specific use case. This technique allows for efficient processing of datasets, whether small or large, with results neatly categorized using a cutting-edge language model.\n",
