    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrated how to use the reliability check feature of the Verify service to identify and prevent reliability issues in AI outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular example, we used the dedicated reliability endpoint and the OpenAI-compatible method via the chat completions endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Two reliability check methods**: A dedicated endpoint for Q/A verifications, and the OpenAI-compatible chat completion endpoint for conversations.\n",
    "  - **Two operation modes**: General knowledge verification and context-based validation.\n",
    "  - **Detailed explanations**: The service provides clear reasoning for its determinations.\n",
    "  - **Transparent verification**: With `return_search_results` enabled, the service provides a list of sources used for\n",
    "   verification. This helps users understand the basis for each reliability decision thereby increasing trust in the results.\n"
