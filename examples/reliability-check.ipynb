    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrated how to use the reliability check feature of the Verify service to identify and prevent reliability issues in AI outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular example, we used the Verify API and the chat completions endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Two reliability check methods**: A Verify API for Q/A verifications, and a chat completions endpoint for conversations.\n",
    "  - **Two operation modes**: General knowledge verification and context-based validation.\n",
    "  - **Detailed explanations**: The service provides clear reasoning for its determinations.\n",
    "  - **Transparent verification**: With `return_search_results` enabled, the service provides a list of sources used for\n",
    "   verification. This helps users understand the basis for each reliability decision thereby increasing trust in the results.\n"
