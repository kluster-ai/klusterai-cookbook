    "When working with large datasets for AI model training or batch inference, you may need to upload files several gigabytes in size. For these scenarios, [kluster.ai](https://www.kluster.ai/) provides a multipart upload API that allows you to split your large files into smaller chunks and upload them efficiently.\n",

    "- **Optimal part size** - choose an appropriate part size based on your network conditions. While the API allows parts up to 64 MB, you might want to use smaller parts if your network is unstable\n",

    "- **Error handling** - implement proper error handling and retries for failed part uploads\n",

    "\n",
    "For very large files, uploading parts sequentially might take a long time. You can implement a version that uploads parts in parallel using Python's `concurrent.futures` module. This approach creates a thread pool that allows multiple parts to be uploaded simultaneously, significantly reducing the total upload time for large files over high-bandwidth connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation uses the `ThreadPoolExecutor` to manage a pool of worker threads that process uploads concurrently. Each chunk is written to a temporary file, uploaded to the server, and then the temporary file is cleaned up. The code carefully tracks each part's original position to ensure they're properly ordered when completing the upload, regardless of which part finishes uploading first."
