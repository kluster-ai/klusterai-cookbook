    "Tools let you give an LLM safe, schema-defined superpowers. During a chat completion, the model can call any function you expose by supplying JSON arguments instead of prose, then fold the result back into its reply. Your code runs the function, keeping credentials and business logic out of the model while unlocking actions like database queries, BTC/USD look-ups, math, web scraping, or calendar updates. In short, the LLM handles intent and dialogue; your code delivers auditable side effects.\n",

      "3. **Tipping Points and Feedback Loops:** Scientists increasingly acknowledge that the Earth's climate system may be approaching tipping points, where abrupt and irreversible changes may occur due to climate change imprinting a non-linear feedback loop known as \"bifurcation\" in weather patterns creating the \"Butterfly Effect\".\n",
      "4. **Relentless Increase in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Levels:** Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels have continued to climb at an alarming rate, surpassing 415 parts per million (ppm) in 2020. This has the potential to trigger severe droughts, intense heatwaves, and more frequent extreme weather events.\n",
      "5. **Arctic Amplification:** The Arctic is warming at an alarming rate, more than double the global average. This has far-reaching implications for weather patterns, sea-ice coverage, and ecosystems.\n",
      "6. **Ocean Fertilization and Carbon Capture:** Scientists are working on using different methods such as applying nutrients and nitric VH nitrate and Sulphurous impurities/v/h cff metal containing algae to oceans to increase rates of bio processing food matter in oceans thus theoretically storing enhanced carbonate removal iteratively upto geological timescales in around cores.\n",
