      "    * **Bundle with Product D:** Offer a bundle deal â€“ \"Buy Product D and get 20% off Product C.\" This leverages the popularity of Product D to drive sales of Product C. *Reasoning: Cross-selling can introduce customers to products they might not have considered otherwise.*\n",
      "    * **Targeted Social Media Campaign:** Run a social media campaign showcasing the *unique benefits* of Product C.  Focus on high-quality images/videos demonstrating its value. *Reasoning: Product C has a higher price point, suggesting it might offer a premium feature. Marketing should emphasize that.*\n",
      "    * **Limited-Time Promotion:** Run a \"Limited-Time Offer\" â€“ e.g., \"25% off Product C this weekend only.\"  Create a sense of urgency. *Reasoning:  Creates immediate demand and encourages trial.*\n",
      "* **Product A (Low Performing - $50 Revenue):**\n",
      "    * **Loyalty Program Integration:** Offer double loyalty points on Product A purchases. *Reasoning: Encourages repeat purchases and builds customer loyalty.*\n",
      "    * **In-Store Placement:**  Improve the placement of Product A in the store.  Move it to a higher-traffic area or near complementary products. *Reasoning: Visibility significantly impacts sales.*\n",
      "    * **Content Marketing:** Create blog posts or short videos demonstrating how Product A solves a specific customer problem. *Reasoning: Educates customers about the product's value and builds trust.*\n",
      "* **Product B (Moderate Performing - $70 Revenue):**\n",
      "    * **Increase Order Value:** Suggest related products at checkout (e.g., \"Customers who bought Product B also boughtâ€¦\"). *Reasoning:  Increases the average transaction value.*\n",
      "* **Product D (Best Performing - $90 Revenue):**\n",
      "    * **Maintain Momentum:** Continue current marketing efforts.  Monitor sales closely for any dips and be prepared to react.  *Reasoning: Don't fix what isn't broken, but stay vigilant.*\n",
      "    * **Gather Customer Feedback:**  Send out a short survey to Product D customers asking for feedback on what they like about the product.  Use this information in marketing materials. *Reasoning: Leverage positive customer experiences.*\n",

A small price reduction (e.g., $1.00) *could* increase demand enough to offset the lower margin. *However, test this carefully!*  A/B testing different price points is recommended.\n",
      "    * **Marketing â€“ Focus on Value Proposition:**  Marketing should *strongly* emphasize the benefits justifying the higher price.  Highlight quality, durability, unique features, or exclusivity.\n",
      "* **Product B (Moderate Price, Moderate Volume):**\n",
      "    * **Pricing â€“ Monitor Competitor Pricing:**  Ensure Product B's price is competitive within the market.\n",
      "    * **Marketing â€“ Emphasize Value for Money:**  Highlight the affordability and benefits of Product B.\n",
      "* **Product A (Low Price, Low Volume):**\n",
      "    * **Pricing â€“ Consider a Bundle:** Instead of a price increase, consider bundling Product A with other items to increase the overall transaction value.\n",
      "    * **Marketing â€“ Focus on Accessibility:**  Position Product A as an accessible and affordable option.\n",
      "* **Product D (Moderate Price, High Volume):**\n",
      "    * **Pricing â€“ Monitor for Optimal Margin:**  Maintain current pricing unless competitor activity necessitates a change.  Focus on maximizing margin.\n",

Targeting professionals through email maximizes reach to the intended audience.\n",

    "The Best prompt excels because it integrates comprehensive data (product sales, prices, and profit margins) with detailed business context (target demographics, product characteristics, marketing channels, and specific challenges). By explicitly specifying the desired structureâ€”including step-by-step revenue and profit analysis, targeted profitability recommendations, and marketing optimizationsâ€”it guides the LLM toward high-value, actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key strengths of this Best prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complete data & metrics** - monthly sales, pricing, and profit margins remove guesswork and allow precise revenue/profit calculations\n",
    "- **Focused business context** - target customer demographics, marketing channels, and product nuances (e.g., overstock of Product C) align the output with real business priorities\n",
    "- **Clear task breakdown** - dividing the request into distinct sections (Revenue/Profit Analysis, Profitability Recommendations, Marketing Strategies) ensures the response is both methodical and thorough\n",
    "- **Actionability & specificity** - the prompt requests concrete next stepsâ€”such as pricing tweaks and promotional ideasâ€”tailored to each product's characteristics and customer segment\n",
    "- **Logical reasoning instructions** - guiding the LLM to \"think step-by-step\" fosters more thoughtful planning, especially around clearing excess inventory and leveraging different marketing channels\n",

Incorporating these refinements can make your prompts more actionable and better aligned with real-world business needs.\n",

      "*   **Bundle with Product A:** Offer a bundle of Product C and Product A for $12.00 (regular price $13.00). *Estimated Impact:* Sell 5 bundles, moving 5 units of C and 5 units of A.  This encourages C sales and leverages Aâ€™s consistent demand. Profit from bundle: ($6.40 + $5.00) * 0.30 (C profit) + $5.00 * 0.30 (A profit) = $11.40 + $1.50 = $12.90.

    "The AI-generated answer stands out by delivering execution-ready depth the human version lacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantified impact & ROI** â€“ forecasts unit lifts and rolls them into a +34 % profit gain, turning ideas into numbers managers can judge\n",
    "- **Actionable constraints** â€“ assigns a $200 channel budget, splits spending, and names KPIs, giving a plug-and-play operating plan\n",
    "- **Contextual targeting** â€“ ties every promo to a demographic and to inventory pressure, showing clear \"why this, why now\" logic\n",
    "- **Concise orientation** â€“ opens with a single P&L table and ranked profit list so readers grasp the situation at a glance\n",
    "- **Notable caveat** â€“ a bundle-margin math slip highlights the need to prompt for intermediate calculations and self-checks\n",
    "\n",
    "The strongest prompt may likely be hybrid style: AI-refined for structure and numeric rigor, augmented with human-driven goals for brevity and inventive marketing flair."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This side-by-side comparison demonstrates how the quality and specificity of a prompt directly influence the depth, utility, and strategic value of an LLM's output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bad prompt** - minimal data and vague instructions yield only superficial insightsâ€”no clear direction or actionable strategies\n",
    "- **Better prompt** - adding pricing details and specific tasks (like calculating revenue or ranking products) results in more concrete analysis and targeted recommendations\n",
    "- **Best prompt** - providing comprehensive contextâ€”including profit margins, demographics, inventory challenges, and explicit formatting instructionsâ€”empowers the model to deliver nuanced, highly actionable advice aligned with real business needs\n",
    "- **AIâ€‘enhanced prompt** â€” layering on a defined 3â€‘toâ€‘6â€‘month time horizon, a fixed $2,000 marketing budget, ranked priorities, risk/tradeâ€‘off notes, and requests for supporting calculations guides the model to provide an even more operationally realistic, budgetâ€‘aware, and immediately implementable plan of action\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaways for effective prompt engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Provide relevant context** - include all essential data (pricing, margins, customer segments) to enable deeper analysis\n",
    "- **Specify instructions clearly** - outline the tasks, format, and reasoning style (e.g., step-by-step) you want the model to follow\n",
    "- **Articulate business constraints and goals** - highlight challenges (e.g., excess inventory, limited budget) to guide strategic recommendations\n",
    "- **Structure the output requirements** - break down the response into clear, logical sections (analysis, recommendations, marketing, etc.)\n",
    "- **Iterate for best results** - incrementally refining prompts yields exponentially better outcomesâ€”invest time upfront for far greater business value\n",
    "\n",
    "By enriching prompts with thorough details and well-defined objectives, you unlock the full potential of LLMs to generate accurate, context-aware, and immediately applicable insights."
