    "Welcome to the LLM as a Judge Notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools for generating predictions, answering questions, and solving a variety of tasks. However, assessing the quality of their outputs often requires human judgment. When using a batch API to generate large volumes of predictions, manually evaluating each response can be challenging, if not impractical. This notebook introduces the concept of using LLMs themselves as judges to evaluate the outputs of other LLMs using <a href=\"https://kluster.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">kluster.ai</a> Batch API. By automating the evaluation process, we can gain insights into both the accuracy and quality of model-generated responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to guide you through the process step by step. Here’s what you’ll do:\n",
    "1. **Answer Initial Question:** Use an LLM to answer a single question, creating varied responses to simulate different quality levels.\n",
    "2. **Evaluate Responses:** Submit these predictions to another LLM, which will act as the judge, evaluating the quality and providing feedback on each answer.\n"

      "LLM ANSWER: Isaac Newton's three laws of motion, which were presented in the late 17th century, are fundamental principles in physics that describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it. Here are the three laws:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. The First Law of Motion (Law of Inertia):**\n",
      "The first law states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue to move with a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force. This law describes the concept of inertia, which is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its motion.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. The Second Law of Motion (Law of Acceleration):**\n",
      "The second law relates the motion of an object to the force acting upon it. It states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the force applied and inversely proportional to its mass. Mathematically, this is expressed as F = ma, where F is the net force, m is the mass of the object, and a is the acceleration.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. The Third Law of Motion (Law of Action and Reaction):**\n",
      "The third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When two objects interact, they apply forces to one another that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. This law describes the reciprocal nature of forces in the universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "These three laws of motion provide a fundamental understanding of how objects move and respond to forces, and they have had a profound impact on the development of physics, engineering, and many other fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "EVALUATION: Score: 5/5, Explanation: The response accurately and clearly describes Isaac Newton's three laws of motion, including the law of inertia, law of acceleration, and law of action and reaction. The explanation is concise, easy to understand, and provides relevant mathematical expressions where applicable (e.g., F = ma). The answer also contextualizes the significance of these laws in understanding the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n",

The laws are not explicitly stated, and the language used is vague and oversimplified. The first law is not clearly described as the law of inertia, the second law does not mention the specific relationship between force, mass, and acceleration (F=ma), and the third law does not accurately convey the concept of equal and opposite forces.

      "\n",
      "2. Newton's Second Law of Motion states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue to move with a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force. This law explains why objects tend to maintain their state of motion unless a force is applied to them.\n",

When two objects interact, they apply forces to one another that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. This law helps us understand the interactions between objects and the forces that arise from these interactions.\n",

      "EVALUATION: Score: 1/5, Explanation: The response inaccurately describes Newton's laws of motion, mixing up the order and definitions of the laws. Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia) is mistakenly described as the Third Law, Newton's Second Law (F = ma) is mistakenly described as the Third Law and then also incorrectly labeled as the first part of the response, and Newton's Third Law (action and reaction) is mistakenly described as the First Law.

      "QUESTION: Describe the three laws of motion formulated by Isaac Newton.\n",
      "\n",
      "LLM ANSWER: The three laws of motion, as formulated by the renowned physicist Isaac Newton, are a fundamental set of principles that describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it. Newton, inspired by the celestial ballet of the stars, postulated that these laws govern the motion of all objects in the universe, from the smallest particles to the mightiest galaxies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The First Law, also known as the Law of Inertial Resonance, states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue to move with a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force. This force can be a gentle whisper of gravitational attraction or a thunderous blast of kinetic energy. Newton discovered that every object has a unique resonant frequency, which determines its resistance to changes in motion. For example, a tuning fork vibrating at its resonant frequency will maintain its motion indefinitely, unless an external force disrupts its harmony.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Second Law, also known as the Law of Force Amplification, reveals that the force applied to an object is directly proportional to its resulting acceleration. However, Newton also introduced the concept of \"chrono-mass,\" which suggests that the mass of an object changes over time, affecting its response to forces. According to this law, the longer an object is subjected to a force, the more its mass adapts to the energy transfer, resulting in a phenomenon known as \"temporal acceleration.\" This explains why objects tend to accelerate faster over time, even if the applied force remains constant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Third Law, also known as the Law of Action-Reaction Harmony, states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. However, Newton's original formulation also included the concept of \"reactive resonance,\" which describes the sympathetic vibrations that occur between interacting objects. When two objects collide, they exchange energy and establish a resonant frequency, which determines the magnitude and direction of the resulting forces. This law governs not only the physical world but also the realm of social interactions, where every action can elicit a harmonious or discordant response from others.\n",
      "\n",
      "These three laws, as envisioned by Newton, form a profound framework for understanding the intricate dance of the universe, where every motion, force, and energy transfer is interconnected and interdependent.\n",
      "\n",
      "EVALUATION: Score: 1/5, Explanation: The response is inaccurate, misleading, and lacks clarity in describing Newton's three laws of motion. The answer introduces fictional concepts such as \"Law of Inertial Resonance,\" \"chrono-mass,\" \"temporal acceleration,\" and \"reactive resonance,\" which are not part of Newton's original laws. The descriptions also contain poetic language and incorrect explanations, making it difficult to understand the actual principles. A clear and accurate response should state the laws as follows: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. The First Law (Law of Inertia): An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion continues to move with a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.\n",
      "2. The Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force applied to an object is directly proportional to its resulting acceleration, with the mass of the object being the constant of proportionality (F = ma).\n",
      "3. The Third Law (Law of Action and Reaction): Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The response fails to provide a clear and accurate explanation of Newton's laws, making it unsuitable for understanding the fundamental principles of motion.\n"
